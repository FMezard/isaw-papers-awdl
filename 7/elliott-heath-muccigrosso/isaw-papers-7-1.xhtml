<section id="section1">
<p class="textindent0">The articles published collectively as <i>ISAW Papers 7</i> are the result of the two meetings held at New York University's Institute for the Study of the Ancient World and at Drew University in early summer of 2012 and 2013 respectively. Both had the title "Linked Ancient World Data Institute" and came to be known by the acronym LAWDI. Organized by the present authors, the meetings were  generously funded by the Office of Digital Humanities of the National Endowment of the Humanities. We are very grateful to the NEH and to our home institutions for their support of the events.</p>

<p>We would also like to thank all the LAWDI participants and all the contributors to this collection. At the LAWDI meetings, we strove for a combination of structured presentation and informal exchange, and here in the publication we intend to offer a forum for description of ongoing work. Different authors have made different use of the opportunity. A common thread is the willingness to make digital resources available on the public internet. But beyond that there is great diversity. Personal perspectives mix with brief reports and with technical discussions. Because all the contributions are informed more or less explicitly by the principles of Linked Open Data (LOD) it will be useful to review those here.</p>

<p>The foundational text for LOD is Tim Berners-Lee's "Linked Data" of 2009, which is online at <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html</a>. The ideas outlined there were described in much greater detail by Tom Heath and Christian Bizer in their 2011 book <i>Linked Data: Evolving the Web into a Global Data Space</i>, which is also available online at <a href="http://linkeddatabook.com/">http://linkeddatabook.com/</a>.</p>

<p>Berners-Lee gave a list of four principles of Linked Data and offered a five-star scale for assessing linked data resources. At LAWDI

<p>Items 1, 2 and 4 are easily rephrased in more colloquial language.
