GODDIO’S spectacular discovery of another Heracleion, the submerged city of Heracleion-Thonis, inspired a traveling exhibition that included a gold stater of Ptolemy I found in the ruins of Heracleion [30]. In 2006 the Harvard University Art Museums added a permanent exhibit of early Hellenistic coins, including four of Ptolemy I; in the catalogue ARNOLD-BIUCCHI [23] favors Alexandria as the original location of Ptolemy’s mint and attributes to Cyrene a gold stater traditionally assigned to Barce, reading the symbol in the exergue as a silphium plant rather than an apple branch. In 2007 SHEEDY [47] mounted and catalogued an exhibition of Hellenistic coins in Sydney, including fourteen Ptolemaic coins, predominantly issues of Ptolemy I, as satrap and as king."/>

Numerous didrachms of Ptolemaic Cyrenaica were hoarded in Crete or overstruck by Cretan cities; the influx of Cyrenean coins can probably be explained by the involvement of Cretan mercenaries in the campaigns of Ophellas and Magas, and/or treaties of Magas with Gortyna and the confederacy of the Oreioi. Ptolemaic royal coinage found in Crete is dominated by issues of Ptolemy II, perhaps to be associated with the Ptolemaic garrison established at Itanos by Patroclus.

DAVESNE [78] has assembled the numismatic evidence for Ptolemaic activity during the Second Syrian War, including hoards, the opening of mints at Ake, Joppa and Gaza and the legend change on Ptolemaic silver to ΠΤΟΛΕΜΑΙΟΥ ΣΩΤΗΡΟΣ (which he sees as programmatic). He reasserts his view that Sv. 894–8, attributed by Svoronos to Ephesus, were minted at Aradus during the period of Ptolemaic control of the city and reassigns the Ptolemaic issues of the Tarsus mint (Sv.  910–911) from the reign of Euergetes to that of Philadelphus in the context of the Second Syrian War. Elsewhere, DAVESNE [79] also suggests that the well-attested spate of countermarking of Ptolemaic issues by the city of Byzantium is the result of the subvention of Philadelphus to the city known from Dion. Byz. 41 and that this occurred during the same war (the generally acccepted date of 280/79 for this episode would rule out such a connection, however: see BRINGMANN, VON STEUBEN [6], p. 271). In fact, a more systematic treatment of the evidence by NOESKE [18] reveals that a sequence of 10 countermarks was used, the earliest appearing on a Ptolemaic issue of 280, the latest on an issue of 246. Noeske notes that the first example of the countermark may be connected with Demetrius’ testimonium, but suggests that Ptolemaic aid must have been ongoing. However, it may well be questioned whether the countermarks have anything to do with Ptolemaic benefactions at all. In general, DAVESNE [79] finds no particular links between the other Syrian Wars fought by Philadelphus (the hypothesised conflict of 281–79 BC, and so-called First Syrian War of 274–1) and reform of or unusual activity at the Ptolemaic mints.  Indeed the major monetary reform dated by Davesne to c. 265 BC is taken to be the reason that Philadelphus could not involve himself in the Chremonidean War in 265/4. Drawing on Davesne’s figures for coin production by the first three Ptolemies (revisited by DAVESNE himself [79], [77]), RODRIGUEZ [108] comes to essentially the opposite conclusion regarding the year 266/5. The spike on Davesne’s graph of Ptolemaic emissions that occurs in this year is taken by Rodriguez as evidence of Philadelphus’ gearing for the conflict. However, caution is required here. This spike is produced in large part by Davesne’s attribution of many undated Ptolemaic issues of the Tyre and Sidon mints to a single year on the basis of their perceived weight loss in the Meydancikkale hoard.

LE RIDER [273] and LORBER [275] both find that the Demanhur hoard implies a date of 324/3 for the opening of the Egyptian mint, though they disagree about its location, Le Rider favoring Alexandria and Lorber Memphis. COHEN [8] vacillates on the location of the mint but uses a long footnote to review the scholarship and ancient sources relevant to interpreting the coin legends ΑΛΕΞΑΔΝΡΕΙΟΝ ΠΤΟΛΕΜΑΙΟΥ and ΑΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΕΙΟΝ. DAHMEN [274] notes that the gold staters with Alexander’s portrait and a prow reverse were the only Ptolemaic coins of their time to circulate outside Egypt and suggests a connection with the Ptolemaic successes on Cyprus. LORBER [275] cites control links between silver and bronze coinage to fix the first reduction of the tetradrachm to 306/5, with subsequent dates lowered accordingly; the weight reduction thus appears as an emergency response to the catastrophic losses in the battle of Salamis. RODRIGUEZ [283] reconstructs Ptolemy’s military assets and correlates changes in his coinage with his military policy, emphasizing iconographic appeals to Macedonian mercenaries but also associating the revival of gold coinage with the necessity of rebuilding the Lagid fleet after the disaster at Salamis. In a paper on the closing of the Ptolemaic monetary economy, DE CALLATAŸ [265] envisions a two-stage reform of the coinage, with a brief reduction of the tetradrachm to c. 14.90 g around 300, followed by a final reduction to c. 14.25 g around 295. His reexamination of the Alexandrian tetradrachms of Ptolemy I in the Meydancikkale hoard reveals that the number of obverse dies has been overestimated and identifies numerous obverse die links between coins with different control marks. He estimates that ten emissions of tetradrachms were produced within a short period of time, perhaps as little as two years."/>

On the basis of these hoards he submits that bronzes with the double eagle reverse remained in circulation over many reigns, filling the period between Isis head bronzes and the coinage of Cleopatra VII, though the absolute chronology remains uncertain. A second-century hoard from Kom Truga, consisting of double eagle bronzes of the type discussed by Picard, is reconstructed by SHAHIN [189]."/>

Among his more interesting suggestions: symbols of the Dioscuri appear on coins intended for the military, but since the Dioscuri were Theoi Soteres, their symbols could also refer to the Theoi Soteres in royal cult, either Cleopatra III and Ptolemy IX or Cleopatra III and Ptolemy X."/>

LARONDE [146] identifies a portrait head of Ptolemy III from Apollonia in Cyrenaica, citing that king’s bronze portrait coins and the tetradrachm Svoronos 996 from the Sophikon hoard. This identification must be treated with caution because of the perfunctory artistic quality of the bronze coins cited and especially because the Sophikon tetradrachm may well represent Ptolemy II rather than Ptolemy III, based on its iconographic similarity to the Tarsian tetradrachms reattributed from Euergetes to Philadelphus by DAVESNE (“La Deuxième Guerre de Syrie (ca. 261–255 avant J.C.) et les témoignages numismatiques,” in M. Amandry and S.  Hurter, eds., Travaux de numismatique grecque offerts à Georges Le Rider (London, 1999), pp. 129–131). PALAGIA [153] identifies a marble head with wings in the Sparta Museum as a portrait of Ptolemy III assimilated to Hermes. As supporting evidence she mentions, inter alia, bronze coins of Abdera that may portray the winged head of a Ptolemy and second-century bronze coins of Marathus allegedly showing Ptolemy III with a caduceus over his shoulder. That the Abderite coins portray a Ptolemy has been questioned most recently by CHRYSSANTHAKI [217], who asserts that Abdera lay outside the area of Ptolemaic control, identifies the winged head as Perseus, and dates the coins to the time of Philip V. The evidentiary value of the Marathus bronzes is also dubious. In her monographic study of Aradus and its peraia [266], DUYRAT emphasizes the strong ties of loyalty to the Seleucids despite formal autonomy, and elsewhere she has described the Marathian coin type simply as Hermes (“Les ateliers monétaires de Phénicie du Nord à l’époque hellénistique,” in C. Augé and F. Duyrat, eds., Les monnayages syriens: Quel apport pour l’histoire du Proche-Orient hellénistique et romain? (Beirut, 2002), pp. 30, 32). In a separate study identifying portrait heads of Berenice II [154], PALAGIA takes a critical view of numismatic evidence, arguing that coin portraits showing the queen with the melon coiffure do not preclude other hairstyles in sculpture, especially if Berenice is portrayed in the guise of a goddess such as Isis or Aphrodite. ASHTON [151] briefly mentions the coin portraits of Ptolemy VI in connection with the possibility of shared sources for statues of Ptolemy VI in Egyptian and Greek style. JOHANSEN [141] emphasizes the value of coins as a source for the iconography of Cleopatra VII and contrasts the style of her portraits on denarii and tetradrachms (where Antony is described, wrongly, as occupying the obverse). FERROUKHI [137] uses coins of Cleopatra VII and Cleopatra Selene as comparanda in identifying portraits in the round but submits that sculptural style trumps comparisons with numismatic iconography, concluding that one of the Cherchell heads found at Caesarea, Mauretania, must depict Cleopatra Selene rather than Cleopatra VII."/>
